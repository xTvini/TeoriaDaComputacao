We are making a merge sort comparison between Python and C.
inside project there are two implementations of merge sort, one in Python and one in C.
and inside project/data there are two datasets, one for each implementation.

using this csv files we need to create:

Charts/tables comparing:
1. the measured times
2. the expected theoretical complexity
3. the execution speed of the chosen languages.

The charts should clearly show the differences in performance between the two implementations, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each language in terms of sorting efficiency.
The tables should include:
- The dataset size
- The measured time taken for sorting
- The theoretical complexity of the algorithm
- The execution speed of the language used
The charts and tables should be well-organized and easy to read, allowing for quick comparisons between the two implementations. Use appropriate labels, legends, and titles to ensure clarity. 
The final output should provide a comprehensive overview of the performance of merge sort in Python versus C, making it easy to draw conclusions about which implementation is more efficient for different dataset sizes.
The charts and tables should be generated using a suitable data visualization library, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn for Python Ensure that the visualizations are aesthetically pleasing and convey the necessary information effectively.
